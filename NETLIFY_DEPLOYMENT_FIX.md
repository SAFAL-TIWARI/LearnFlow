# Netlify Deployment Fix

## Problem
Netlify was trying to deploy the project as a Next.js application due to:
1. Presence of `next-env.d.ts` file
2. Next.js dependencies in package.json (`next`, `next-auth`, `next-themes`)
3. NextAuth plugin in vite.config.ts

This caused the error: **"Deploy failed due to an error in @netlify/plugin-nextjs plugin"**

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Next.js Environment File
- ✅ Deleted `next-env.d.ts` file (not needed for Vite projects)

### 2. Updated Netlify Configuration (`netlify.toml`)
- ✅ Added `NETLIFY_NEXT_PLUGIN_SKIP = "true"` to disable Next.js plugin
- ✅ Added `NETLIFY_SKIP_FRAMEWORK_DETECTION = "true"` to disable auto-detection
- ✅ Set `FRAMEWORK = "static"` to force static site deployment
- ✅ Kept build command as `npm run build:netlify`

### 3. Added MIME Type Headers (`public/_headers`)
- ✅ Created comprehensive `_headers` file for proper MIME types
- ✅ Specific headers for JavaScript modules (`text/javascript; charset=utf-8`)
- ✅ Headers for all asset types (CSS, images, fonts, etc.)
- ✅ Security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, etc.)

### 4. Enhanced Build Process
- ✅ Updated build script to copy `_headers` file to dist
- ✅ Added `_headers` to essential files verification
- ✅ Created `.nvmrc` file to ensure Node.js 18 usage

### 5. Build Verification
- ✅ All essential files present in dist:
  - `index.html`
  - `404.html`
  - `_redirects`
  - `_headers`
  - `favicon.ico`
  - `assets/` directory with JS and CSS files

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files:
1. `netlify.toml` - Enhanced with framework detection overrides
2. `scripts/build-for-static-hosting.js` - Added _headers copying
3. `scripts/fix-deployment.js` - Enhanced verification

### New Files:
1. `public/_headers` - MIME type and security headers
2. `.nvmrc` - Node.js version specification

### Removed Files:
1. `next-env.d.ts` - Unnecessary for Vite projects

## Deployment Instructions

### For Netlify (via GitHub):
1. **Commit and push all changes** to your GitHub repository
2. **Netlify will automatically detect the changes** and start a new deployment
3. **The build should now succeed** using the static site configuration
4. **Verify the deployment** at your Netlify URL

### Build Commands:
- **Production Build**: `npm run build:netlify`
- **Publish Directory**: `dist`
- **Node.js Version**: 18 (specified in .nvmrc)

## Expected Results

✅ **No more Next.js plugin errors**
✅ **Proper MIME types for JavaScript modules**
✅ **Static site deployment instead of framework detection**
✅ **All assets served with correct headers**
✅ **SPA routing working with _redirects**

## Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify:
- [ ] Website loads without console errors
- [ ] No MIME type errors in browser console
- [ ] JavaScript modules load correctly
- [ ] CSS styles apply properly
- [ ] SPA routing works (no 404s on page refresh)
- [ ] All interactive features function
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness maintained

## Troubleshooting

If the deployment still fails:
1. Check Netlify build logs for specific errors
2. Verify all files are committed to GitHub
3. Ensure the build command is set to `npm run build:netlify`
4. Confirm publish directory is set to `dist`
5. Check that Node.js version is 18 in Netlify settings

## Technical Notes

- The project uses **Vite + React**, not Next.js
- NextAuth is used for authentication but in a Vite context
- The `_headers` file provides file-level MIME type control
- Framework detection is explicitly disabled to prevent conflicts
