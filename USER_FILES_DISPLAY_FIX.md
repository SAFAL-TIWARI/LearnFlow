# User Files Display Fix

This document explains the fixes implemented to resolve the following issues:
1. Files appearing twice in the "Your upload files" section
2. Files disappearing after refreshing the page
3. Files not being properly stored in the Supabase user-files bucket

## Root Causes

1. **Duplicate Files Issue**: 
   - The `handleFileUpload` function was adding files to the state twice - once when they're uploaded and again when `fetchUserFiles` was called.
   - The code wasn't properly checking for duplicates when merging files from different sources.

2. **Files Disappearing After Refresh**:
   - Files were being uploaded to Supabase storage correctly, but there were issues with the database records.
   - The code was using both localStorage and database storage, which caused inconsistencies.
   - There was no unique constraint on the user_id and file_path columns in the database.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Code Changes

1. **Modified `handleFileUpload` function in ProfilePage.tsx**:
   - Added checks for existing files before uploading to prevent duplicates
   - Improved error handling and recovery
   - Fixed the state update logic to prevent duplicate entries
   - Changed the file refresh mechanism to avoid adding duplicates

2. **Modified `fetchUserFiles` function in ProfilePage.tsx**:
   - Added duplicate detection and prevention
   - Improved error handling and fallback mechanisms
   - Enhanced the file processing logic to ensure all required fields are present
   - Added proper ordering of files (newest first)

### 2. Database Fixes

Created a SQL script (`fix_user_files_final.sql`) that:
1. Identifies and removes duplicate file entries
2. Adds a unique constraint on user_id and file_path to prevent future duplicates
3. Ensures all files have proper public_url values
4. Sets is_public to true for any null values
5. Creates an index on user_id for better performance
6. Creates a function to get all accessible files for a user
7. Adds a trigger to ensure updated_at is set properly

## How to Apply the Fixes

### Step 1: Apply the Database Fixes

Run the SQL script against your Supabase database:

```sql
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL editor or via psql
-- The script is designed to work with different column names
-- and will check for the existence of columns before making changes

-- Copy and paste the contents of fix_user_files_final.sql here
```

### Step 2: Deploy the Code Changes

The code changes have been made to:
- `src/pages/ProfilePage.tsx`

Deploy these changes to your production environment.

### Step 3: Verify the Fixes

After applying the fixes:
1. Log in to your application
2. Navigate to the "Your upload files" section
3. Upload a new file and verify it appears only once
4. Refresh the page and verify that all files are still visible
5. Check the Supabase dashboard to confirm files are properly stored in the user-files bucket

## Additional Notes

- The fixes maintain backward compatibility with existing data
- Files are now properly persisted in both the database and localStorage for redundancy
- The unique constraint on user_id and file_path prevents duplicate uploads
- Error handling has been improved to provide better feedback to users

If you encounter any issues after applying these fixes, please check the browser console for error messages and the Supabase logs for database errors.
